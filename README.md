bpmwrap - BPM tagging made easier
=======

## Description:   
This BASH script is a wrapper for bpm-tag utility of [bpm-tools](http://www.pogo.org.uk/~mark/bpm-tools/) and several audio tagging utilities. The purpose is to make BPM (beats per minute) tagging as easy as possible.  
Default behaviour is to look through working directory for *.mp3 files and compute and print their BPM in the following manner:  
```
[current (if any)] [computed] [filename]
```

## Usage:
```
bpmwrap [options] [directory or filenames]
```
You can specify files to process by one of these ways:  
- state files and/or directories containing them after options  
- specify --import file  
- specify --input file  

With either way you still can filter the resulting list using --type option(s). Remember that the script will process only mp3 files by default, unless specified otherwise!  

## Options:

- -i, --import file  
	Use this option to set BPM tag for all files in given file instead of computing it. Expected format of every row is BPM number and absolute path to filename separated by semicolon like so:
```
145;/home/trinity/music/Apocalyptica/07 beyond time.mp3
```
- -n, --input file
	Use this option to give the script list of FILES to process INSTEAD of paths where to look for them. Each row whould have one absolute path.  
	This will bypass the searching part and is that way useful when you want to process large number of files several times. Like when you are not yet sure what BPM limits to set. Extension filtering will still work.
- -o, --output file  
	Save output also to a file.
- -l, --list-save file
	Save list of files about to get processed. You can use this list later as a file for --input option.
- -t, --type  
	Extension of file type to work with. Defaults to mp3. Can be specified multiple times for more filetypes. Currently supported are mp3 ogg flac.
- -e, --existing-only  
	Only show BPM for files that have it. Do NOT compute new one.
- -w, --write  
	Write computed BPM to audio file but do NOT overwrite existing value.
- -f, --force  
	Write computed BPM to audio file even if it already has one. Aplicable only with --write option.
- -m, --min minbpm  
	Set minimal BPM to look for when computing. Defaults to bpm-tag minimum 84.
- -x, --max maxbpm  
	Set maximal BPM to look for when computing. Defaults to bpm-tag maximum 146.
- -v, --verbose  
	Show "progress" messages.
- -c, --csv-friendly  
	Use semicolon (;) instead of space to separate output columns.
- -h, --help  
	Show this help.

## Note:
Program bpm-tag (on whis is this script based) is looking only for lowercase file extensions. If you get 0 (zero) BPM, this should be the case. So just rename the file.
